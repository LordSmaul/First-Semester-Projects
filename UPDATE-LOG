(5/18/2022) UPDATE: 
I am currently working on copying all of my programs in this folder into Java to gain some knowledge of Java. I had some experience
coding in Java in high school (which is what got me into Computer Science), so it hasn't been too difficult with some of the labs. The later
labs and programming assignments will be more challenging, though.
