(8/25/2022) UPDATE:
I am still working on converting all the programs to Java. 
It is much more difficult to devote time to this, since I have little time due to current schoolwork and related activities, as well as a part-time job. 
My patience for Java is also very limited the more I learn about the language...
I am, however, beginning a class in which I will learn Python, so maybe converting all the programs into Python could present a fresh new start.
And potentially an easier project, at that.

(5/18/2022) UPDATE: 
I am currently working on copying all of my programs in this folder into Java to gain some knowledge of Java. 
I had some experience coding in Java in high school (which is what got me into Computer Science), so it hasn't been too difficult with some of the labs. 
The later labs and programming assignments will be more challenging, though.
