The '*' symbol is the dereferencing operator. It is also the indirection operator.
The '&' symbol means "address of" and is called the address operator.
The name of an array, without any brackets acts as a pointer to the starting address of the array.
A pointer variable can hold the memory address of a variable.
The statement "cout << ptr;" will print an address.
The statement "cout << *ptr;" will print 3.75.
The statement "cout << &pay;" will print an address.
The statement "cout << pay;" will print 3.75.
Yes. ptr = &another_pay.
Not really; ptr references a float variable, not an integer. You could change "ptr" to hold an int value, which would work.
