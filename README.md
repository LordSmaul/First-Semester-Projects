# First-Semester-Projects

This folder contains all of the coding labs and assignments from my first semester in an introductory Computer Science course at my college. I decided it would be a good idea to post all the files online to preserve them in case I get a new computer.

There are two types of assignments here: Labs and Projects. The labs were given weekly to help the students practice what they had learned in the lectures. The projects were assigned every couple of weeks; they were generally more comprehensive in their scope and supposed to be harder than the labs, and we were given more time to complete them.

All projects have been edited from their original forms: I have taken the liberty of removing personal information (since this folder is public) and reduced the assignments to the source files, executables, and any text files that the programs use.

**Here's a quick rundown of the assignments and their goals:**

Lab 1: Basic "Hello World!" program

Lab 2: Basic user input and mathematics functions within main()
-   (a) calculating cost of hot wings 
-   (b) getting user input of groceries and printing it back w/ total cost 
-   (c) average test grade of 3 students
-   (d) calculating prison sentence of a dog who stole bones

Lab 3: Introduction of conditionals (logic, relational) and string processing within main()
-   (a) Finding the smallest number from user input
-   (b) Determining whether a user input year is a leap year
-   (c) Output coin change of a user based on a given user input dollar amount
-   (d) Setting a user password based on user input

Lab 4: More practice with conditionals/switches, intro to 'while' loop within main()
-   (a) Using logical operators to determine student's graduation status
-   (b) Switch statement with letter grades
-   (c) While loop with user input

Lab 5: More complex uses of loops and other random useful tidbits within main()
-   (a) Gives user a nickname, using random number generation and ASCII decimal conversions
-   (b) 'while' and 'do-while' loops with input validation from user
-   (c) Getting the average of the consecutive numbers between two user-input numbers using 'while' and 'for' loops

Lab 6: Practice with functions in separate files, intro to header files, basic multi-parameter geometric funtions from user input

Lab 7: Similar to lab 6, with different geometric functions, and intro to variables passed by reference

Lab 8: Introduction to Arrays; documenting paranormal findings and determing highest number found on a given day from user input

Lab 9: Introduction to pointers, and some exception handling
-   (b) Execption handling if user inputs wrong variable type
-   (c) Basic mathematics with pointers

Lab 10: Validating a password for certain conditions based on user input
- user password must contain at least one uppercase and lowercase letter, a number, a punctuation character, and no spaces

Lab 11: Practice with pointer arrays; getting/displaying pollution data from user input

Lab 12: Intro to structures; building an array of eSports player structures from user input and displaying their game/time information

Program 1: Practice with basic user input, arithmetic operators, and random generation
 - Program gives the user two randomly generated numbers and asks them to find the solution to the arithmetic operator of their choice, then asks them if the          resulting number is positive/negative and even/odd, displaying correct messaging for all potential input types

Program 2: Practice with loops, conditionals, separate files, and header files
 - Program asks the user for a number, then outputs: the sum from 1 to that number, the factorial of that number, a times table, whether the number is even/odd, whether or not the number is prime, and whether or not the number is an Armstrong number

Program 3: Intro to file reading
 - Program reads in numbers from a file into an array, then performs a series of operations:
 - (1) Prints the sum of all numbers in the file
 - (2) Counts/prints number of even/odd numbers
 - (3) Counts/prints the number of positive/negative numbers
 - (4) Prints the sums of the mirror index pairs of the array
 - (5) Displays the array forwards and backwards
 - (6) Finds the max number, min number, mean, and median of the array
 - At my own leisure I also wrote a separate function that populates a .txt file with numbers to make testing the program easier and more randomized 

Program 4: File reading with structures
- Program creates a pointer array of user-defined structures for students; each student structure contains their name, a generated email, and some test scores. The program then generates a letter grade and prints out the information of the students who scored best on each test and the student who scored best overall
