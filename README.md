# First-Semester-Projects

This folder contains all of the coding labs and assignments from my first semester in an introductory Computer Science course at my college. I decided it would be a good idea to post all the files online to preserve them in case I get a new computer.

There are two types of assignments here: Labs and Projects. The labs were given weekly to help the students practice what they had learned in the lectures. The Projects were assigned every couple of weeks; they were generally more comprehensive in their scope and supposed to be harder than the labs, and we were given more time to complete them.

All projects have been edited from their original forms: I have taken the liberty of removing personal information (since this folder is public) and reduced the assignments to the source files, executables, and any text files that the programs use.

Here's a quick rundown of the assignments and their goals:
